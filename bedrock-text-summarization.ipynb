    "# Text Summarization using Amazon Bedrock API \n",
    "## GenAI Code Accelerator \n",
    "Author: Sundaresan Manoharan - Enterprise Architecture AI/ML Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of breaking down large texts into smaller parts. It uses deep learning and machine learning models to extract important information while preserving the meaning of the text from a text document and presenting it in a concise and coherent format. It allows digesting and distilling the essence from large volumes of content efficiently. It is a key capability of LLMs with many potential applications across industries to improve understanding and save time. This notebook demostrates text summarization using Amazon Bedrock API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This approach can be used when the input text or file fits within the model context length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: A key challenge is managing large documents that exceed the token limit. Another is obtaining high quality summaries. We will explore an approach to address the challenge when users have large document(s) that exceed the token limit and how to measure the summarization quality in the advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Meeting/Call Transcripts\n",
    "- Policy, Legal, Government Documents\n",
    "- Books, Articles, Blogs, Research Papers\n",
    "- Financial Reports \n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation Model(s):\n",
    "- Amazon Titan Large\n",
    "- Meta LLaMa 13B\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces Text Summarization using Amazon Bedrock API.  \n",
    "- Uses various Foundation Models (LLM agnostic)\n",
    "- Uses a PDF document (Earnings Call Transcript, Business/Financial Reports)\n",
    "- Uses simple and easy to adapt bite size'd code accelerator"

There remains a robust pipeline of new \\napartment rental projects that are underway in the nation’s largest metros, and with recessionary concerns there has \\nbeen a rise in the number of properties across the country offering concessions.\\nIn the multifamily apartment rental market, concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as \\nperiods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities. And in a competitive market when property owners need to fill \\nvacant units, concessions are one of the ways they attract tenants. As seen in the charts below, recent concessions data \\nfrom RealPage show that the multifamily market has seen softening trends over the past year: There is a notably higher \\npercentage of units offering concessions than a year ago –  up from 5.2% of all units in August 2022 to 9.0% of all units \\nin August 2023. However, the value of the concession being offered has slightly declined, from 7.7% of asking rent in \\nAugust 2022 to 7.2% in August 2023, which is slightly less than one month’s free rent. It’s important to note that the \\noverall level of concessions continues to be well above the low levels observed just before the pandemic. \\nSource: RealPage\\nSupply of New Units Remains High\\nAccording to the Dodge Data & Analytics Supply Track construction pipeline data, the number of apartment units \\ncompleted across the country may reach a record in 2023. According to Dodge, as of the middle of 2023, nearly 730,000 \\nunits were underway with completion dates expected in 2023, though only 164,000 were completed year to date through \\nApril. That’s compared to full -year totals of 479,000 units in 2022 and 395,000 units in 2021. The overall pipeline \\nunderway is slightly lower than it was in the prior year: As of July 2023, 1,116,000 units were underway, compared to \\n1,141,000 in July 2022. With supply chains operating more efficiently in 2023 than in 2022, substantially more units may \\nbe completed this year than last, which we believe might lead to about 500,000 units delivering this year.

New York City continues to be the most active metro in the country, with nearly 150,000 units \\neither recently completed or underway, with Dallas next at 74,000 units. Houston and Atlanta are also each expecting at \\nleast 50,000 units will be completed this year. \\nThe robust supply in many of these markets, along with consumer skittishness over economic trends, appears to have \\nimpacted demand. As seen below, with the exceptions of New York and Chicago, all have seen the percentage of units \\noffering concessions rise compared to the prior year. Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix have each seen increases of more than \\n5%. It is noteworthy, however, that eight of the 12 markets shown below have seen concession values decline over the pri or \\nyear, and that the largest increase, in Phoenix, was just 2.8%. We believe that these mixed trends suggest that demand for \\nrental apartments has declined so quickly, especially over the past few months, that combined with competition from new \\nunits coming online, Class A unit property owners are instead dropping asking rents to lure in new tenants. \\nConcession % of Asking Rent \\n(Left Axis)% of Units Offering Concessions \\n(Right Axis)\\n3Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\n4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0%8.0%9.0%10.0%11.0%\\nA B CHigher Class A Concessions Continue, More B and C Offering Concessions\\nDuring the current multi -year development cycle, multifamily builders have primarily been constructing more \\nexpensive, amenity -offering apartments, usually referred to as Class A units. As seen in the charts below, with \\nincreased competition among this class, property owners have had to offer a generally higher level of concession, as \\nwell as more properties having to offer them. The value of Class A concessions increased significantly at the beginning \\nof the pandemic and has remained comparatively high, well above Class B and C units during this period. And over the \\npast year, as demand has softened compared to the prior year, the value of concessions for Class A units has declined \\nslightly, from 8.6% in August 2022 to 8.1% in August 2023, most likely due to the decrease in asking rents. But the \\npercent of Class A units offering these concessions has risen more notably, from 6.7% a year ago to 9.5% as of August \\n2023.\\nThe softening demand for apartments over the past year is also observed in the rising percentage of units offering \\nconcessions in Class B and C units. As of August 2022, 4.8% of Class B units were offering concessions, while just 3.7% \\nof Class C were. But both classes have seen noteworthy increases: As of August 2023, 8.4% Class B units were offering \\nconcessions, up 3.6% from the prior year, and 9.2% of Class C units were, up 5.5% from the prior year.\\nNational monthly concession rates by class\\nSource: RealPage, Inc. \\nIts is noteworthy, however, that the value of the concession being offered has not changed significantly among Class \\nB and C units over the past year. Class B units have slightly decreased the value of the concessions being offered, \\nfrom 6.8% a year ago to 6.5% in August 2023. However, the value of Class C concessions has risen slightly, increasing \\nfrom 6.5% a year ago to 6.7% in August 2023.\\nThe mixed signals across all three classes of properties indicate that overall demand has softened and that many \\nproperty owners have decided to move quickly by dropping asking rents combined with offering a slightly lower \\nconcession as an offset in an attempt to bring in new tenants. 2.0%4.0%6.0%8.0%10.0%12.0%14.0%16.0%18.0%20.0%\\nA B CPercent of units offering concessions by class\\n4Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nFurther Softening Expected to Lead to More Concessions and Stagnant Rent Growth\\nAfter exceptional rent growth rates in 2021 and 2022, it was generally expected that 2023 would see easing of \\nmultifamily rent growth and overall fundamentals, including vacancy rates. In general, that has been the case. \\nSoftening in demand during the first half of this year resulted in a below -average rent growth of just 1.0% for \\nthe nation, and a modest rise in vacancies. But some metros had notably weaker results, experiencing modest \\nrent contractions, including Austin, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Phoenix. \\nBecause of this fundamental demand softness, and our current expectation of a mild recession in the first half \\nof 2024, a further rise in the number of units offering concessions may be on the horizon. It is noteworthy that \\namid significantly weaker conditions in 2023 compared to 2022 the value of concessions offered by property \\nowners has been generally stable; instead, property owners have moved to offering lower asking rent levels.  \\nHowever, with a robust pipeline of supply expected over the next 18 months, we believe there will continue to \\nbe pressure on owners to offer more generous concessions along with lower rents. Combining that new \\ncompetition with likely unemployment increases and a rental household formation slowdown would likely \\nresult in owners using a combination of both options to not only retain their current tenants but to also gain \\nnew ones. And that would still include all classes of units, including the more affordable Class B and C.\\nWe believe the forecasted economic slowdown, combined with the robust supply of new apartment units that \\nare underway, will likely add stress to the multifamily sector over the next 12 to 18 months. But we continue to \\nbelieve that demand for multifamily rental housing will remain stable over the longer term due to home \\npurchase affordability constraints and higher interest rates keeping many tenants from moving to \\nhomeownership. As a result, we believe that many renters -by-choice will stay in their units for slightly longer, \\nespecially if they are able to take advantage of lower rent levels and more generous concessions.\\nMultifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\n5Tim Komosa\\nEconomist - Senior Manager\\nMultifamily Economics and Research\\nOctober 2023\\nOpinions, analyses, estimates, forecasts, and other views of Fannie Mae’s Economic and \\nStrategic Research (ESR) Group included in these materials should not be construed as \\nindicating Fannie Mae’s business prospects or expected results, are based on a number of \\nassumptions, and are subject to change without notice.

    "#### Randomness and Diversity\n",
    "For any given sequence, a model determines a probability distribution of options for the next token in the sequence. To generate each token in an output, the model samples from this distribution. Randomness and diversity refer to the amount of variation in a model's response.\n",

    "        Choose a higher value to influence the model to select lower-probability outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In technical terms, the temperature modulates the probability mass function for the next token. A lower temperature steepens the function and leads to more deterministic responses, and a higher temperature flattens the function and leads to more random responses.\n",
