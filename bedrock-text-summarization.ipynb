       "'1Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nOCTOBER 2023\\nRising Number of Multifamily Properties Offering Concessions\\nMultifamily market fundamentals have softened in 2023 compared to the prior year, the result of mixed economic \\ntrends including slowing -but-still -positive job growth, elevated single -family housing prices keeping many renters in \\nplace, and continued favorable demographics. Rent growth was exceptional over the past two years, and, of course, \\nunsustainable, thus 2023 has seen a substantial slowing of rent growth rates. There remains a robust pipeline of new \\napartment rental projects that are underway in the nation’s largest metros, and with recessionary concerns there has \\nbeen a rise in the number of properties across the country offering concessions.\\nIn the multifamily apartment rental market, concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as \\nperiods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities. And in a competitive market when property owners need to fill \\nvacant units, concessions are one of the ways they attract tenants. As seen in the charts below, recent concessions data \\nfrom RealPage show that the multifamily market has seen softening trends over the past year: There is a notably higher \\npercentage of units offering concessions than a year ago –  up from 5.2% of all units in August 2022 to 9.0% of all units \\nin August 2023. However, the value of the concession being offered has slightly declined, from 7.7% of asking rent in \\nAugust 2022 to 7.2% in August 2023, which is slightly less than one month’s free rent. It’s important to note that the \\noverall level of concessions continues to be well above the low levels observed just before the pandemic. \\nSource: RealPage\\nSupply of New Units Remains High\\nAccording to the Dodge Data & Analytics Supply Track construction pipeline data, the number of apartment units \\ncompleted across the country may reach a record in 2023. According to Dodge, as of the middle of 2023, nearly 730,000 \\nunits were underway with completion dates expected in 2023, though only 164,000 were completed year to date through \\nApril. That’s compared to full -year totals of 479,000 units in 2022 and 395,000 units in 2021. The overall pipeline \\nunderway is slightly lower than it was in the prior year: As of July 2023, 1,116,000 units were underway, compared to \\n1,141,000 in July 2022. With supply chains operating more efficiently in 2023 than in 2022, substantially more units may \\nbe completed this year than last, which we believe might lead to about 500,000 units delivering this year. Multifamily concession rate National % of multifamily units offering concessions\\n3%5%7%9%11%13%15%17%\\n5.5%6.0%6.5%7.0%7.5%8.0%8.5%9.0%\\n2Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nConcessions Declining in Most Major Markets \\nSource: RealPageMultifamily monthly concession rate by market – select metrosAs has been the case for several years, new apartment supply has been concentrated in the nation’s largest and rapidly \\ngrowing metropolitan areas. New York City continues to be the most active metro in the country, with nearly 150,000 units \\neither recently completed or underway, with Dallas next at 74,000 units. Houston and Atlanta are also each expecting at \\nleast 50,000 units will be completed this year. \\nThe robust supply in many of these markets, along with consumer skittishness over economic trends, appears to have \\nimpacted demand. As seen below, with the exceptions of New York and Chicago, all have seen the percentage of units \\noffering concessions rise compared to the prior year. Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix have each seen increases of more than \\n5%. It is noteworthy, however, that eight of the 12 markets shown below have seen concession values decline over the pri or \\nyear, and that the largest increase, in Phoenix, was just 2.8%. We believe that these mixed trends suggest that demand for \\nrental apartments has declined so quickly, especially over the past few months, that combined with competition from new \\nunits coming online, Class A unit property owners are instead dropping asking rents to lure in new tenants. \\nConcession % of Asking Rent \\n(Left Axis)% of Units Offering Concessions \\n(Right Axis)\\n3Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\n4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0%8.0%9.0%10.0%11.0%\\nA B CHigher Class A Concessions Continue, More B and C Offering Concessions\\nDuring the current multi -year development cycle, multifamily builders have primarily been constructing more \\nexpensive, amenity -offering apartments, usually referred to as Class A units. As seen in the charts below, with \\nincreased competition among this class, property owners have had to offer a generally higher level of concession, as \\nwell as more properties having to offer them. The value of Class A concessions increased significantly at the beginning \\nof the pandemic and has remained comparatively high, well above Class B and C units during this period. And over the \\npast year, as demand has softened compared to the prior year, the value of concessions for Class A units has declined \\nslightly, from 8.6% in August 2022 to 8.1% in August 2023, most likely due to the decrease in asking rents. But the \\npercent of Class A units offering these concessions has risen more notably, from 6.7% a year ago to 9.5% as of August \\n2023.\\nThe softening demand for apartments over the past year is also observed in the rising percentage of units offering \\nconcessions in Class B and C units. As of August 2022, 4.8% of Class B units were offering concessions, while just 3.7% \\nof Class C were. But both classes have seen noteworthy increases: As of August 2023, 8.4% Class B units were offering \\nconcessions, up 3.6% from the prior year, and 9.2% of Class C units were, up 5.5% from the prior year.\\nNational monthly concession rates by class\\nSource: RealPage, Inc. \\nIts is noteworthy, however, that the value of the concession being offered has not changed significantly among Class \\nB and C units over the past year.

However, the value of Class C concessions has risen slightly, increasing \\nfrom 6.5% a year ago to 6.7% in August 2023.\\nThe mixed signals across all three classes of properties indicate that overall demand has softened and that many \\nproperty owners have decided to move quickly by dropping asking rents combined with offering a slightly lower \\nconcession as an offset in an attempt to bring in new tenants. 2.0%4.0%6.0%8.0%10.0%12.0%14.0%16.0%18.0%20.0%\\nA B CPercent of units offering concessions by class\\n4Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nFurther Softening Expected to Lead to More Concessions and Stagnant Rent Growth\\nAfter exceptional rent growth rates in 2021 and 2022, it was generally expected that 2023 would see easing of \\nmultifamily rent growth and overall fundamentals, including vacancy rates.

Concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as periods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities.
