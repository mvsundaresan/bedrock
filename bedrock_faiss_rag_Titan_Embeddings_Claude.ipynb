    "# FAISS RAG Q&A Pattern with Amazon Bedrock using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to solve a Question Answering task over a larger document corpus with the help of LLMs we need to master the following challenges (amongst others):\n",
    "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
    "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infusing knowledge into LLM-powered systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two primary: \n",
    "- **Parametric knowledge**: refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM. \n",
    "- **Source knowledge**: covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to infuse knowledge into a generative AI - powered application we need to choose which of these types to target. Fine-tuning, explored in other workshops, deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to utilize the RAG (retrieval-agumented generation) pattern originating from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) paper published by Lewis et al in 2021. It is particularily useful for Question Answering by finding and leveraging the most useful excerpts of documents out of a larger document corpus providing answers to the user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/Embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Load the documents\n",
    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "#### Ask question\n",
    "![Question](./images/Chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: \n",
    "    - PDF Loader available through LangChain for PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "  These are loaders that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: FAISS available through LangChain\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using this in-memory vector-store to store both the embeddings and the documents. In an enterprise context this could be replaced with a persistent store such as AWS OpenSearch, RDS Postgres with pgVector, ChromaDB, Pinecone or Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️⚠️⚠️ For this lab we need to run the notebook based on a Python 3.10 runtime. ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "To run this notebook you would need to install 2 more dependencies, [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) and [FAISS vector store](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Anthropic Claude to demonstrate the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock. You can replace the `model_id` as follows to change the model.\n",
    "\n",

      " page_content='1Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nOCTOBER 2023\\nRising Number of Multifamily Properties Offering Concessions\\nMultifamily market fundamentals have softened in 2023 compared to the prior year, the result of mixed economic \\ntrends including slowing -but-still -positive job growth, elevated single -family housing prices keeping many renters in \\nplace, and continued favorable demographics. Rent growth was exceptional over the past two years, and, of course, \\nunsustainable, thus 2023 has seen a substantial slowing of rent growth rates. There remains a robust pipeline of new \\napartment rental projects that are underway in the nation’s largest metros, and with recessionary concerns there has \\nbeen a rise in the number of properties across the country offering concessions.\\nIn the multifamily apartment rental market, concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as \\nperiods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities. And in a competitive market when property owners need to fill \\nvacant units, concessions are one of the ways they attract tenants. As seen in the charts below, recent concessions data \\nfrom RealPage show that the multifamily market has seen softening trends over the past year: There is a notably higher \\npercentage of units offering concessions than a year ago –  up from 5.2% of all units in August 2022 to 9.0% of all units \\nin August 2023. However, the value of the concession being offered has slightly declined, from 7.7% of asking rent in \\nAugust 2022 to 7.2% in August 2023, which is slightly less than one month’s free rent. It’s important to note that the \\noverall level of concessions continues to be well above the low levels observed just before the pandemic. \\nSource: RealPage\\nSupply of New Units Remains High\\nAccording to the Dodge Data & Analytics Supply Track construction pipeline data, the number of apartment units \\ncompleted across the country may reach a record in 2023. According to Dodge, as of the middle of 2023, nearly 730,000 \\nunits were underway with completion dates expected in 2023, though only 164,000 were completed year to date through \\nApril. That’s compared to full -year totals of 479,000 units in 2022 and 395,000 units in 2021. The overall pipeline \\nunderway is slightly lower than it was in the prior year: As of July 2023, 1,116,000 units were underway, compared to \\n1,141,000 in July 2022. With supply chains operating more efficiently in 2023 than in 2022, substantially more units may \\nbe completed this year than last, which we believe might lead to about 500,000 units delivering this year.

Rent growth was exceptional over the past two years, and, of course, \\nunsustainable, thus 2023 has seen a substantial slowing of rent growth rates. There remains a robust pipeline of new \\napartment rental projects that are underway in the nation’s largest metros, and with recessionary concerns there has \\nbeen a rise in the number of properties across the country offering concessions.\\nIn the multifamily apartment rental market, concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as \\nperiods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities. And in a competitive market when property owners need to fill \\nvacant units, concessions are one of the ways they attract tenants. As seen in the charts below, recent concessions data \\nfrom RealPage show that the multifamily market has seen softening trends over the past year: There is a notably higher \\npercentage of units offering concessions than a year ago –  up from 5.2% of all units in August 2022 to 9.0% of all units \\nin August 2023. However, the value of the concession being offered has slightly declined, from 7.7% of asking rent in \\nAugust 2022 to 7.2% in August 2023, which is slightly less than one month’s free rent. It’s important to note that the \\noverall level of concessions continues to be well above the low levels observed just before the pandemic. \\nSource: RealPage\\nSupply of New Units Remains High\\nAccording to the Dodge Data & Analytics Supply Track construction pipeline data, the number of apartment units \\ncompleted across the country may reach a record in 2023. According to Dodge, as of the middle of 2023, nearly 730,000 \\nunits were underway with completion dates expected in 2023, though only 164,000 were completed year to date through \\nApril. That’s compared to full -year totals of 479,000 units in 2022 and 395,000 units in 2021. The overall pipeline \\nunderway is slightly lower than it was in the prior year: As of July 2023, 1,116,000 units were underway, compared to \\n1,141,000 in July 2022. With supply chains operating more efficiently in 2023 than in 2022, substantially more units may \\nbe completed this year than last, which we believe might lead to about 500,000 units delivering this year.

It is noteworthy that \\namid significantly weaker conditions in 2023 compared to 2022 the value of concessions offered by property \\nowners has been generally stable; instead, property owners have moved to offering lower asking rent levels.  \\nHowever, with a robust pipeline of supply expected over the next 18 months, we believe there will continue to \\nbe pressure on owners to offer more generous concessions along with lower rents.

Rent growth was exceptional over the past two years, and, of course, \\nunsustainable, thus 2023 has seen a substantial slowing of rent growth rates. There remains a robust pipeline of new \\napartment rental projects that are underway in the nation’s largest metros, and with recessionary concerns there has \\nbeen a rise in the number of properties across the country offering concessions.\\nIn the multifamily apartment rental market, concessions are incentives with an economic value for renters, such as \\nperiods of free rent, free utilities, or other amenities. And in a competitive market when property owners need to fill \\nvacant units, concessions are one of the ways they attract tenants. As seen in the charts below, recent concessions data \\nfrom RealPage show that the multifamily market has seen softening trends over the past year: There is a notably higher \\npercentage of units offering concessions than a year ago –  up from 5.2% of all units in August 2022 to 9.0% of all units \\nin August 2023. However, the value of the concession being offered has slightly declined, from 7.7% of asking rent in \\nAugust 2022 to 7.2% in August 2023, which is slightly less than one month’s free rent. It’s important to note that the \\noverall level of concessions continues to be well above the low levels observed just before the pandemic. \\nSource: RealPage\\nSupply of New Units Remains High\\nAccording to the Dodge Data & Analytics Supply Track construction pipeline data, the number of apartment units \\ncompleted across the country may reach a record in 2023. According to Dodge, as of the middle of 2023, nearly 730,000 \\nunits were underway with completion dates expected in 2023, though only 164,000 were completed year to date through \\nApril. That’s compared to full -year totals of 479,000 units in 2022 and 395,000 units in 2021. The overall pipeline \\nunderway is slightly lower than it was in the prior year: As of July 2023, 1,116,000 units were underway, compared to \\n1,141,000 in July 2022. With supply chains operating more efficiently in 2023 than in 2022, substantially more units may \\nbe completed this year than last, which we believe might lead to about 500,000 units delivering this year. Multifamily concession rate National % of multifamily units offering concessions\\n3%5%7%9%11%13%15%17%\\n5.5%6.0%6.5%7.0%7.5%8.0%8.5%9.0%', metadata={'name': 'FNMA Selling Guide 2024', 'source': 'https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/media/38401/display'}), Document(page_content='4Multifamily Economic and Market Commentary\\nFurther Softening Expected to Lead to More Concessions and Stagnant Rent Growth\\nAfter exceptional rent growth rates in 2021 and 2022, it was generally expected that 2023 would see easing of \\nmultifamily rent growth and overall fundamentals, including vacancy rates. In general, that has been the case. \\nSoftening in demand during the first half of this year resulted in a below -average rent growth of just 1.0% for \\nthe nation, and a modest rise in vacancies. But some metros had notably weaker results, experiencing modest \\nrent contractions, including Austin, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Phoenix. \\nBecause of this fundamental demand softness, and our current expectation of a mild recession in the first half \\nof 2024, a further rise in the number of units offering concessions may be on the horizon. It is noteworthy that \\namid significantly weaker conditions in 2023 compared to 2022 the value of concessions offered by property \\nowners has been generally stable; instead, property owners have moved to offering lower asking rent levels.  \\nHowever, with a robust pipeline of supply expected over the next 18 months, we believe there will continue to \\nbe pressure on owners to offer more generous concessions along with lower rents. Combining that new \\ncompetition with likely unemployment increases and a rental household formation slowdown would likely \\nresult in owners using a combination of both options to not only retain their current tenants but to also gain \\nnew ones. And that would still include all classes of units, including the more affordable Class B and C.\\nWe believe the forecasted economic slowdown, combined with the robust supply of new apartment units that \\nare underway, will likely add stress to the multifamily sector over the next 12 to 18 months. But we continue to \\nbelieve that demand for multifamily rental housing will remain stable over the longer term due to home \\npurchase affordability constraints and higher interest rates keeping many tenants from moving to \\nhomeownership. As a result, we believe that many renters -by-choice will stay in their units for slightly longer, \\nespecially if they are able to take advantage of lower rent levels and more generous concessions.', metadata={'name': 'FNMA Selling Guide 2024', 'source': 'https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/media/38401/display'})]\n"
