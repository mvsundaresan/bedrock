    "# Large File Summarization using LangChain/LCEL with Bedrock API \n",
    "## GenAI Code Accelerator \n",
    "Author: Sundaresan Manoharan - Enterprise Architecture AI/ML Team\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well with the **`Data Science 3.0`** kernel in SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of breaking down large texts into smaller parts. It uses deep learning and machine learning models to extract important information while preserving the meaning of the text from a text document and presenting it in a concise and coherent format. It allows digesting and distilling the essence from large volumes of content efficiently. It is a key capability of LLMs with many potential applications across industries to improve understanding and save time. This notebook demostrates text summarization using Amazon Bedrock API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: A key challenge is managing large documents that exceed the token limit. Another is obtaining high quality summaries. When we work with large documents, we can face some challenges as the input text might not fit into the model context length, or the model hallucinates with large documents, or, out of memory errors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve those problems, we are going to show an architecture that is based on the concept of chunking and chaining prompts. This architecture is leveraging LangChain which is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Books, Articles, Blogs, Research Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation Model(s):\n",
    "- Amazon Titan Lite\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces Text Summarization using Amazon Bedrock API.  \n",
    "- Uses various Foundation Models (LLM agnostic)\n",
    "- Uses a PDF document (Large document which doesn't fit LLM context window)\n",
    "- Uses simple and easy to adapt bite size'd code accelerator\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert Architecture Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "In this architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A large document (or a giant file appending small ones) is loaded\n",
    "1. Langchain utility is used to split it into multiple smaller chunks (chunking)\n",
    "1. First chunk is sent to the model; Model returns the corresponding summary\n",
    "1. Langchain gets next chunk and appends it to the returned summary and sends the combined text as a new request to the model; the process repeats until all chunks are processed\n",
    "1. In the end, you have final summary based on entire content\n"

      "Fannie Mae is a company that helps people buy or rent homes by providing mortgage financing. It has two reportable business segments: Single-Family and Multifamily. The 2022 ESG Report provides information on the company's business and operations with a focus on social impact, sustainability, and responsible governance. Fannie Mae's ESG strategy is designed around two core objectives: improving access to equitable and sustainable housing and enhancing its financial and risk positions. The company's ESG team works to deepen its understanding of ESG priorities and solutions, benefiting from enterprise-wide connectivity and visibility, engagement with external stakeholders, and Board-level oversight. Fannie Mae's priority ESG topics include business ethics, climate resilience, climate risk, community engagement, data privacy and security, diversity and inclusion, ESG integration, green homes, housing affordability, housing stability, human capital management, racial equity in housing finance, regulatory engagement, and risk management. Fannie Mae issues labeled Green Bonds backed by single-family loans and labeled Green and Social Bonds backed by multifamily loans, which abide by its Sustainable Bond Framework. The framework received a second-party opinion from Sustainalytics and incorporates the Multifamily and Single-Family Green Bond Frameworks. Fannie Mae's Green Bonds finance assets that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Fannie Mae is committed to financing energy- and water-efficient improvements in multifamily and single-family housing through its Green Homes chapter, Green Bond issuance, and Projected Green Bond Impacts. It also offers Single-Family Green Bonds, which are backed by pools of mortgage loans secured exclusively by newly constructed single-family homes with green building certifications. In 2022, Fannie Mae issued $1.4 billion in Single-Family Green MBS and $781 million in Green resecuritizations. The ACCESS program was developed in 1992 to promote diversity within the capital markets. Fannie Mae issued its first Multifamily Social Bonds in 2021 to better connect interested investors to its loans financing affordable housing units with and without rent and/or income restrictions, manufactured housing communities, and Healthy Housing Rewards properties. In 2022, $587 million of the multifamily bonds issued met the criteria for both Social and Green labels. Fannie Mae provides ESG information at the security level, including whole multifamily property energy and water performance metrics. Fannie Mae offers various ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics and data, including ENERGY STAR Score and EPA's Water Score, in DUS Disclose. Projected impacts of Green and Social Bonds are available on the website. Single-Family Social Index scores are available in PoolTalk and Data Dynamics. Fannie Mae introduced the Single-Family Social Index in 2022 to provide investors with insights into mission-oriented activities and preserve mortgage consumers' personal information. The index evaluates loans against eight social criteria grouped under three dimensions. Pool-level metrics include Social Criteria ShareTM and Social Density ScoreTM. Fannie Mae provides Social Index scores for most active and inactive pools issued since January 2010. Loans on second homes are not eligible for any criteria, and households with income greater than 120% of Area Median Income are not eligible for most social criteria. The Social Index methodology includes dimensions such as income, borrower, first-time homebuyer, property, minority tract, high-needs rural, and designated disaster area. Fannie Mae supports the U.S. housing market by acquiring and guaranteeing mortgage loans, bringing housing affordability to renters and borrowers. It acquires single-family mortgage loans from lenders and offers options for low down payment financing and consumers with limited or no credit history. It also eases the burden of upfront costs for low-income and first-time homebuyers by allowing low down payments and down payment assistance. Loans with as little as 3% down are eligible for financing under Fannie Mae's guidelines. Fannie Mae is a company that helps make mortgages more accessible to people who might not otherwise be able to get one. They have a program called HomeReady that helps low-income families buy homes. In 2022, they helped over 79,000 families buy homes through this program. To qualify for HomeReady, families must meet certain income requirements and have a credit score of at least 620. They also need to have a down payment of at least 3%. Fannie Mae also offers a program called Community Seconds, which allows borrowers to get conventional mortgage financing while also receiving home purchase assistance through certain secondary mortgage financing programs. In 2022, they helped over 26,000 families buy homes through this program. Fannie Mae is working to make renting and buying homes more affordable for people of all backgrounds. They are working to make rental payments count toward credit scores and to help people overcome credit history barriers. They are also working to make sure that mortgage lenders consider a borrower's positive rent payment history when evaluating their loan application. Fannie Mae is committed to making quality housing more accessible and affordable for people. It has made improvements to its automated underwriting system to responsibly expand access for homebuyers who do not have a credit score. It also invests directly in improvements to its real estate owned (REO) properties, conducts repairs on a majority of the properties it acquires, and offers a closing cost concession of up to 3% of the HomePath property sales price to owner-occupant buyers with a household income equal to or less than the Area Median Income. In 2022, 76% of its single-family REO property sales were to owner-occupant homebuyers. Fannie Mae's Community First by Fannie Mae program offers approved public entities and community-minded organizations exclusive purchase access to REO properties for a limited time. Manufactured homes (MH) are a significant source of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income borrowers, but certain factors can make purchasing them more difficult. In 2022, Fannie Mae provided $4.4 billion in liquidity to the single-family manufactured housing market. Fannie Mae is focused on supporting the preservation, rehabilitation, and creation of more affordable rental homes for renters. In 2022, Fannie Mae financed approximately 598,000 multifamily units, with a significant majority being affordable to low-to-moderate-income households. Fannie Mae is innovating with programs that make it easier for households to afford and maintain suitable rental housing. Multifamily housing affordability is a primary barrier to housing affordability for renters, resulting in competition for available units. Fannie Mae is focused on supporting the preservation, rehabilitation, and creation of more affordable rental homes for renters. In 2022, Fannie Mae financed approximately 598,000 multifamily units, with a significant majority being affordable to low-to-moderate-income households. Fannie Mae is innovating with programs that make it easier for households to afford and maintain suitable rental housing. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is a federal program incentivizing equity investments in affordable rental housing for low- and very low-income households. Fannie Mae has provided approximately $3.2 billion in LIHTC equity investments since 2018, supporting the creation or preservation of nearly 80,000 rental units at over 1,000 properties in 49 of 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington, D.C. Fannie Mae is committed to providing affordable housing to diverse groups, including Native Americans, homeless people, youth aging out of foster care, LGBTQ seniors, and people who have experienced domestic violence. They offer financing for properties with supportive services and high-quality, affordable housing and have increased their loan purchase targets on LIHTC properties. They also offer pricing and underwriting incentives for borrowers and lenders to set aside at least 20% of units for households with income less than 80% of AMI. The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program is a key resource for providing direct affordable housing subsidies to very low-income households, seniors, historically underserved populations, and people with disabilities. Fannie Mae launched the Expanded Housing Choice Initiative in 2022 to enlarge the pool of multifamily units that accept HCVs. They are committed to complying with Fair Lending Laws, which prohibit discrimination in housing and lending on the basis of certain characteristics. They require their lender partners to comply with Selling Guides, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and other related state and federal regulations. They have also developed a Fair Lending Program to prevent, identify, measure, mitigate, and manage enterprise-wide fair lending risks. Mae's Fair Lending Group ensures fair lending practices by reviewing policies, conducting enterprise monitoring, and delivering training. In 2022, Fannie Mae agreed to pay $53 million to resolve a lawsuit alleging discriminatory maintenance and marketing of foreclosed properties.\n"

Fannie Mae's Multifamily Green Bond Frameworks received Light Green and Good Governance Second Opinions from CICERO Shades of Green. Fannie Mae's Multifamily Green Rewards Mortgage Loan product received a Light to Medium Green rating. Fannie Mae is a leading provider of financing for multifamily and single-family housing. They offer a range of green financing options, including Multifamily Green MBS, Single-Family Green MBS, and Multifamily Social Bonds. Green MBS are pools of mortgage loans that are backed by green building certifications and offer geographic or property-type diversity. Single-Family Green MBS is backed by pools of mortgage loans secured exclusively by newly constructed single-family homes with green building certifications. Multifamily Social Bonds are issued to connect interested investors to affordable housing loans. Fannie Mae provides security-level reporting on ESG metrics related to energy and water performance, including ENERGY STAR Score and EPA's Water Score. Fannie Mae is committed to ESG principles and transparency. They have introduced the Single-Family Social Index to provide investors with insights into their mission-oriented activities in the residential real estate financing market. The index is based on eight social criteria grouped under three dimensions. Loans are evaluated at time of acquisition and pool-level metrics are calculated based on the composition of pools when they are issued. Fannie Mae also provides Green Bond Disclosures and Social Index scores for most active and inactive pools issued since January 2010. The Single-Family Social Index measures loans against eight social criteria, including income, minority borrowers, first-time homebuyers, property, low-income area, minority tract, high-needs rural, and designated disaster area. Loans on second homes are not eligible for any criteria, and households with income greater than 120% of Area Median Income are not eligible for most social criteria. Fannie Mae's business model helps to bring housing affordability to renters and borrowers around the country. They acquire single-family mortgage loans from lenders who originate those loans to borrowers. These loans include options for low down payment financing and consumers with limited or no credit history. Fannie Mae is a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise that provides mortgage financing to help more families achieve the dream of homeownership. It offers a range of mortgage products, including HomeReady, which is designed to help low-income borrowers. Fannie Mae also works to make homeownership more affordable by providing down payment assistance and working with lenders to reduce closing costs. Additionally, Fannie Mae is working to make rental payments count toward credit scores and to overcome credit history barriers for underserved consumers. Fannie Mae is committed to making quality housing more accessible and affordable for people. They have made improvements to their automated underwriting system to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of borrowers' monthly cash flow, which can help expand access for homebuyers who may not have a credit score. Additionally, Fannie Mae offers financing options like HomeStyle Renovation loans to help homeowners finance improvements to their properties. They also invest directly in repairs to their real estate owned (REO) properties to make them more sustainable and attractive to owner-occupant buyers. Fannie Mae also provides access to properties on HomePath without competition for the first 30 days, and offers a closing cost concession to owner-occupant buyers with a household income equal to or less than the Area Median Income. Manufactured homes (MH) are a vital source of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income individuals. They are typically less expensive to purchase or rent than site-built homes, but certain factors can make purchasing them more difficult, such as difficulty obtaining financing. In 2022, Fannie Mae provided $4.4 billion in liquidity to the single-family manufactured housing market. Native American tribal members, people who have experienced homelessness, youth aging out of foster care, LGBTQ seniors, and people who have experienced domestic violence. Properties focusing on these tenants may include supportive services such as counseling, after-school programs, and job training in addition to providing high-quality, affordable housing.
